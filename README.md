This project predicts the total fare of NYC taxi rides using machine learning.

## 📊 Results
* **Best Model:** Random Forest Regressor
* **R-squared Score:** 0.81
* **RMSE:** $5.99

## 🛠️ Key Features
- **Distance:** Trip distance in miles.
- **Time-based Features:** Hour of day, Day of week.
- **Duration:** Calculated trip length in minutes.

## 📈 Learnings
Linear Regression provided a solid baseline ($R^2=0.78$), but the Random Forest model handled the non-linear nature of NYC traffic and surcharges much better.
